Description: This package provides the tools to create visual aids to help students understand convolutions of distributions.
    Given a function f, the kernel g, and the resulting convolution f * g, the program provides a visual of the kernel sweeping across
    the function f, and illustrating how the new distribution f * g arises.
    The package also provides tools using discrete plots to allow the user to provide visuals of how the sum of discrete uniform distributions
    converges to a normal distribution.
